                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>The Biology Undergraduate Research Club was created in the Spring of 2022 by Dr. Laura Francis and Dr. Rosa Moscarella. The Club's initiative was to provide students with different interest and experience levels to come together and talk to peers about their experiences. While at first the Club was an initiative that only supported Biology Majors at the University, we have expanded and now integrate members from all of the Life Sciences. </p>

                            <p>We have hosted a variety of different meetings, ranging from having guest appearances from the Career Center to hosting a number of researchers on campus. Every BURC meeting is different in its own way, with a goal of delivering precise information and developing the sense of community a place like research should have.</p>

            <h2>Why BURC?</h2>

            <pr>Be it establishing a first connection to research, getting to know new peers, or learning about ongoing research on campus, BURC aims to bring along a wide variety of different members and become a safe space for the spread of awareness about the importance of research. In the past we have hosted Principal Investigators, a Graduate Student Panel, brought forth the importance of experiences when school is not in session, as well as provided a platform for undergraduates to share their experiences and research in front of an audience. At BURC we hope to continue to develop networking opportunities and connections in order to facilitate the sprouting of knowledge and information. We believe that with the correct information and support system, science is approachable for all. We aim to positively impact our members’ scientific careers, and also to prepare them for the future that will happen outside of the academic world.</pr>
